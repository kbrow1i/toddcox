* Unix-like systems

Toddcox should build easily on any Unix-like system.  Here are some
specifics:

** Linux

Type 'make' at a shell prompt.  This should yield three executable
programs, tc, tc+, and tcf, in the current directory.  You can
optionally type 'make install' to create stripped executables in the
'bin/linux' subdirectory.

** Cygwin

Install the 'make' package and a package containing a C++ compiler,
such as 'gcc4-g++'.  Then issue the following command at a Cygwin
shell prompt:

  make -f Makefile.cygwin

This should yield three executable programs, tc.exe, tc+.exe, and
tcf.exe, in the current directory.  You can optionally type 'make -f
Makefile.cygwin install' to create stripped executables in the
'bin/cygwin' subdirectory.

** Other Unix-like systems

The Linux instructions may very well work without change.  If not, you
might have to make minor changes at the beginning of the Makefile to
specify your compiler, for instance.  If anyone who makes such a
change sends me the resulting Makefile, I will include it in future
releases.

* Windows

The build procedure on Windows is similar to the build on Unix-like
systems, provided one has a suitable build environment that includes a
C++ compiler.  For example, one can build native Windows executables
in the Cygwin environment by using the cygwin-mingw cross compiler
provided by Cygwin's mingw-gcc-g++ package.  To do this, issue the
following command at a Cygwin shell prompt:

  make -f Makefile.cygwin-mingw

You can optionally type 'make -f Makefile.cygwin-mingw install' to
create stripped executables in the 'bin/windows' subdirectory.

* Unix-like systems

Toddcox should build easily on any Unix-like system.  Here are some
specifics:

** Linux

Type 'make' at a shell prompt.  This should yield two executable
programs, tc and tc+, in the current directory.  You can optionally
type 'make install' to create stripped executables in the 'bin'
subdirectory.

** Cygwin

Install the 'make' package and a package containing a C++ compiler,
such as 'gcc4-g++'.  Then issue the following commands at a Cygwin
shell prompt:

  cp Makefile.cygwin Makefile
  make

This should yield two executable programs, tc.exe and tc+.exe, in the
current directory.  You can optionally type 'make install' to create
stripped executables in the 'bin' subdirectory.

** Other Unix-like systems

The Linux instructions may very well work without change.  If not, you
might have to make minor changes to the Makefile to specify your
compiler, for instance.  If anyone who makes such a change sends me
the resulting Makefile, I will include it in future releases.  I am
also happy to distribute prebuilt executables for other systems.

* Windows

Windows users can either install Cygwin and follow the instructions
above or else install any C++ compiler and use it.  If anyone does
this and sends me detailed instructions, I will include them in future
releases.  I am also happy to distribute prebuilt Windows executables.

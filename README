If you have obtained a prebuilt executable for your system, you can
skip the first item and proceed directly to "Running the program".

* Building Toddcox

See the `INSTALL' file in the source distribution for instructions.
After following the instructions, you should have an executable
program called `toddcox' possibly with `.exe' appended, either in your
current directory or somewhere in your path.

* Running the program

Type 'toddcox' at a command prompt.  Depending on how your path is set
up, you may have to include a path specification.  On a typical
Unix-like system, for example, you would type

  ./toddcox

if the `toddcox' program is contained in your current directory but
not in your path.

The program will prompt you to enter the necessary information.  See
<http://www.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/toddcox/doc.html> for
documentation, including some sample runs of the program.  A copy of
this file will be in your system documentation directory
(/usr/local/share/doc/toddcox by default) if you are working on a
Unix-like system and have run `make install' after building Toddcox.

* Running from a script

Instead of responding to all the prompts interactively, you can enter
them into a file and give the filename as a command-line argument.
The Toddcox source distribution contains several sample input files in
the `examples' directory.  Those files have been installed on your
system (in /usr/local/share/toddcox/examples by default) if you are
working on a Unix-like system and have run `make install' after
building Toddcox.  See the README file in that directory for a
description of the examples.

To run toddcox on the M12 example, for instance, issue the following
command:

  ./toddcox examples/M12.in

This assumes that your current directory is the top-level directory of
the Toddcox source distribution and that the `toddcox' executable is
in that directory.  Alternatively, if you have installed Toddcox on
your Unix-like system, the command might be

  toddcox /usr/local/share/toddcox/examples/M12.in

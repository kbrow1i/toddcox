If you have obtained a prebuilt executable for your system, you can
skip the first item and proceed directly to "Running the program".

* Building Toddcox

See the INSTALL file in the source distribution for instructions.
After following the instructions, you should have an executable
program called toddcox (possibly with .exe appended).

* Running the programs

Type 'toddcox' at a command prompt.  Depending on how your path is set
up, you may have to include a path specification.  On a typical
unix-like system, for example, you would type

  ./toddcox

if the toddcox program is contained in your current directory.

The program will prompt you to enter the necessary information.  See
<http://www.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/toddcox/doc.html> for
documentation, including some sample runs of the program.

* Running from a script

Instead of responding to all the prompts interactively, you can enter
them into a file and give the filename as a command-line argument.
The Toddcox source distribution contains several sample input files in
the 'examples' directory.  See the README file in that directory for a
description of the examples.  To run toddcox on the M12 example, for
instance, issue the following command:

  ./toddcox examples/M12.in

This assumes that the 'toddcox' executable is in the top-level
directory of the Toddcox source distribution.

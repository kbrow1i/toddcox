<h2>How to use <tt>toddcox</tt></h2>

<p>
The <tt>toddcox</tt> program enumerates the cosets of a subgroup H of
a group G.  The simplest way to use it is to start it and respond to
the prompts.  Here is a sample run in which G is the alternating group
on four letters, with two generators a,b and relations a<sup>3</sup>
&equals; b<sup>3</sup> &equals; (ab)<sup>2</sup> &equals;&nbsp1.  The
subgroup H is the cyclic group generated by&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp; User
input is shown in red.
</p>

<pre>
$ <b><font color=red>./toddcox</font></b>

This program uses the Todd-Coxeter procedure to compute the
index in a finitely presented group G of a subgroup H.  You
will be prompted to enter the number of generators of G, the
defining relators of G, and the generators of H.  Use
a,b,... for the generators of G and A,B,... for their
inverses.

Number of generators: <b><font color=red>2</font></b>
Enter the relators for G, one per line; press Enter when finished:
> <b><font color=red>aaa</font></b>
> <b><font color=red>bbb</font></b>
> <b><font color=red>abab</font></b>
>       <b><font color=red><--- user pressed Enter</font></b>
Enter the generators of H, one per line; press Enter when finished:
> <b><font color=red>a</font></b>
>       <b><font color=red><--- user pressed Enter</font></b>

The index of H in G is 4.
The coset table had size 4 before compression.

Compressed and standardized coset table:

       a   A   b   B
 1:    1   1   2   3
 2:    3   4   3   1
 3:    4   2   1   2
 4:    2   3   4   4
</pre>

<p>
Here is a second example.  The group G is the Mathieu group
M<sub>12</sub>, which is a simple group of order 95040, with three
generators a,b,c and relations
<pre>
   a<sup>11</sup> &equals; b<sup>2</sup> &equals; c<sup>2</sup> &equals; (ab)<sup>3</sup> &equals; (ac)<sup>3</sup> &equals;(bc)<sup>10</sup> &equals; 1, &nbsp; a<sup>2</sup>(bc)<sup>2</sup> &equals;(bc)<sup>2</sup>a<sup>-1</sup>
</pre>
The subgroup H is the trivial group.

<p>
Note that the coset table was not printed on the terminal because it
was too large.  In this case the user is given the option of
specifying a file to which to print the table.  In the example above
the user simply pressed Enter to quit without printing the table.
</p>

<h2>Specifying an input file</h2>

<p>
To save typing, we can put the group-theoretic information in a file,
exactly as we would enter it in response to the prompts (including
blank lines).  We then specify the filename as a command-line argument
to the program.  For example, suppose we have a file <tt>M12.in</tt>
with the following contents:
</p>

<pre>
3
aaaaaaaaaaa
bb
cc
ababab
acacac
bcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbc
aabcbcaCBCB
       <b><font color=red><--- blank line</font></b>
       <b><font color=red><--- blank line</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
We could then repeat the example above by giving the command
<tt>toddcox M12.in</tt>.  The <tt>Toddcox</tt> distribution contains
several such input files in the <tt>examples</tt> subdirectory, as
well as a README file describing the examples.
</p>

<h2>Notes for advanced users</h2>

<p>
There are several methods for carrying out coset enumeration.  See,
for instance, <em>Handbook of Computational Group Theory</em> by Holt
et al, which describes three methods (HLT, HLT+lookahead, and Felsch).
The <tt>toddcox</tt> program uses the HLT method by default, but
command-line options can make it use the other two methods.  For
example, one can give the command
<pre>
toddcox --felsch [FILE]
</pre>
to use the Felsch method.  Here [FILE] is an optional input file, such
as <tt>M12.in</tt>.  For HLT+lookahead, the user specifies a positive
integer <em>threshold</em>.  The program then proceeds as in the HLT
method, but if a step in that method causes the coset table to get
bigger than <em>threshold</em>, the program uses lookahead to try to
reduce the size to at most <em>threshold</em>.  If it succeeds,
processing continues.  Here is an example that uses a threshold of
200,000 on the Mathieu group mentioned above.  We assume the
presentation is given in a file <tt>M12.in</tt> as above.
</p>

<pre>
$ <b><font color=red>./toddcox --threshold 200000 M12.in</font></b>

Threshold exceeded; table size is 200006.  Looking ahead...
Table size is now 68727.  Continuing.

Threshold exceeded; table size is 200006.  Looking ahead...
Table size is now 91503.  Continuing.

The index of H in G is 95040.
The coset table had size 121996 before compression.

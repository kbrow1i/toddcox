<h2>The Todd&ndash;Coxeter procedure</h2>

<p>
Many computer algebra systems, such
as <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a>, provide
implementations of the Todd&ndash;Coxeter coset enumeration procedure.
There are also sophisticated standalone implementations, such as
<a href="http://itee.uq.edu.au/~cram/ce.html">ACE</a> (which is also
available as a 
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/ace.html">GAP
package</a>).  In spite of this, I have written yet another
implementation, called <tt>Toddcox</tt>.  It is a toy version,
intended for pedagogical use.
</p>

<p>
I have used <tt>Toddcox</tt> in
my <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/6310/">graduate
algebra course</a>.  I have also written
a <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/6310/toddcox.pdf">brief
introduction</a> to the Todd&ndash;Coxeter procedure for that course.
</p>

<p>
My goals in writing <tt>Toddcox</tt> were the following:
<ul>
  <li>A student should be able to learn how to use it in a few
  minutes.</li>
  <li>It should work reasonably quickly on small examples.</li>
  <li>
    The code should be transparent; anyone who is familiar with the
    language (<tt>C++</tt>) should be able to read the code and see
    how it relates to standard treatments of coset enumeration (such
    as the one in <em>Handbook of Computational Group Theory</em> by
    Holt et al).
  </li>
</ul>
I did <em>not</em> worry about efficiency.  If you want to do a
time-consuming or memory-intensive coset enumeration, you should use
one of the standard implementations of the Todd&ndash;Coxeter
procedure.
</p>

<p>
To obtain Toddcox, visit
the <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~kbrown/toddcox/download.html">download</a>
page.  More information, including sample runs of the program, can be
found on the <a href="doc.html">documentation</a> page.
</p>

<p>
I do not expect to spend a lot of time developing the program further,
since it suffices for my purposes.  But I will certainly try to fix
any bugs that are reported, and I will try to implement suggestions
for improvement if they're not too difficult and they don't detract
from the goals stated above.  I would appreciate hearing from anyone
who uses the program, and I would especially appreciate hearing about
any improvements that you make.
